# Testing whether there is a periodic component in measurements of G

The `src` directory contains an ipython notebook (requiring `matplotlib`, `numpy` and `cython`) to test the [claim](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06604) of a periodic 5.9 year sinusoidal signal in measurements of Newton's gravitational constant using Bayesian model selection.
